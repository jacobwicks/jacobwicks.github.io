title: 'Testing Documate interviews using TypeScript, Cypress, and Gherkin-JavaScript '
---

Goal of the project: Create a Chrome Browser Plugin that provides an easy to use GUI for creating and running tests of Documate interviews.

Components:
Documate is a frontend built on DocAssemble. DocAssemble is an open source project that lets users build interviews, which are stored as .yml files, to create documents. Documate is simpler and more restrictive than DocAssemble.

Cypress is a testing framework that runs unit and integration tests using web browsers.

Gherkin is a human readable scripting language that lets technical and non-technical people collaborate to specify test actions and test results in conversational language.

Chrome is a web browser.
Chrome Browser Extensions extend the functionality of the web browser.

So here's what the workflow will look like:

-   User opens Web browser
-   User navigates to documate site
-   User logs in to documate
-
