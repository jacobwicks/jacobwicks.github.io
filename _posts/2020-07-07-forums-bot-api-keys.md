1. Enter Api Keys
The basic bot setup uses four different apis to take its actions.

 * catApi
 * deepai
 * Imgur
 * Twitter

Some actions depend on these apis. For example, the action that posts a picture of a cat won't work without the cat Api key. To get it working you'll have to sign up for the cat api and enter the key in the control panel.
