### What is lineComments?

lineComments is a project that lets you attach comments to a single line of code in codeBlocks in your Jekyll blog posts.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName firstExample
//heres some really complicated code
{% endhighlight %}

<div class='lineComment' id='{block: firstExample, line: 1}'>
This is an explanation of what's going on in line 1.
</div>

### Why make lineComments?

I like to give very specific explanations of what code does. I think going into detail about parts of the language that will be well known to experienced programmers is helpful for beginners. When starting out it can be very frustrating to try and grasp the main point of an article when it includes many other operations that advanced users are already familiar with, but doesn't explain what those are. The problem with explaining too much is that it can be hard to connect the explanation of a line or part of a block of code to the actual code. It is hard to connect the explanation to the code without losing context, cluttering the page, or making the article too long, which can distract from the main point. So I decided to make it possible to float comment boxes next to specific lines of code. That way the explanation is clearly visually connected to the code that is being explained. This helps the reader keep the ideas connected, while saving vertical screen space. The explanations are collapsed, keeping the page relatively free of clutter and allowing the reader to focus. lineComments also supports collapsing codeBlocks using the html details and summary elements.

### How can I use it in my Jekyll blog?

## Install

# Download the Files from Github

First, download the lineComments files from the git repo.

# Put the Files in Your Blog Folders

In your blog folder, you probably already have an folder named 'assets' a folder named '\_includes'. If you don't have them, then create them.

Put lineCommentsMobile.html in the '\_includes' folder.

Inside the 'assets' folder, create a new folder named 'lineCommentsMobile'.
Put lineComments.css into the lineCommentsMobile folder.
Put lineComments.js into the lineCommentsMobile folder.
Put the modules folder in the lineCommentsMobile.

## Use

# Include lineCommentsMobile.html in Each Post Where You Want to Use it

Add this tag at the bottom of each blog post where you want to use lineComments.

{% raw %}
{% include lineCommentsMobile.html %}
{% endraw %}

# Tag the Code Blocks

Use Liquid tags to tag your code block.

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
const helloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!');
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

# Optional: Name the Code Blocks

The easiest way to keep track of the code blocks that you are adding comments to is to name each code block. To name a code block start the first line of the code with 'blockName' followed by the string that you want to name the block. When lineComments runs it will strip the blockName out, so the blockName will not be displayed to the reader.

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName hello world
const helloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!');
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

You don't have to name code blocks to attach comments. If you don't name a code block, you can still attach comments to it by it's index (e.g. it's the third code block on the page, it's block index is 2). But that's harder than just naming the code block.

# Make the Comment Divs

A comment needs to be inside a div element. Give the div the class "lineComment". Give the div an id property that identifies the assigned block and the line number. Here's an example:

```
<div class = "lineComment" id='{
    block: hello world,
    line: 1
    }'>
Hello world is the best thing to say in a program
</div>
```

## Comment Ids

# in JSON format

# In String format

index or blockName will both work

```
<div class = "lineComment" id="block.2.line.17">
Like this
</div>;
```

# Refer to code blocks by index or name

# Collapsible code blocks

You can put your code blocks and comments inside a collapsible element using [HTML5 details elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) and summary elements.

The summary element is optional. If you want the summary element to look right with markdown, you have to assign it `markdown='span'`. You also have to have it on the same line as the details opening tag. I think this is something to do with how Jekyll treats HTML.

```
{% raw %}
<details><summary markdown='span'>Write your summary here</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName collapsibleHelloWorld
const helloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!');
{% endhighlight %}
</details><br/>
{% endraw %}
```

I like to follow the details closing tag with a break tag, otherwise there won't be a space after the line. The break tag is optional.

Putting the code block in a details element gives you this:

<details><summary markdown='span'>Write your summary here</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName collapsibleHelloWorld
const helloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!');
{% endhighlight %}
</details><br/>

<div class='lineComment' id='{block: collapsibleHelloWorld, line: 1}'>
This comment doesn't show up until you open the details element.
</div>

Comments assigned to the block will be hidden while the details element is collapsed.

### To Install LineComments in your Jekyll blog

o Download LineComments from Github
o Put it in the folders
o Change your config file
o Include it at the bottom of the post
â€¢ Source Code

### How Does LineComments work?

## Jekyll generates HTML from markdown.

You write your blog entry using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown lets you add tags to your text to format it for easy reading. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) reads the markdown file and turns it into HTML. Jekyll can also read HTML inside the markdown files.

# Format Code Blocks Using Liquid Tags

When you include code blocks in your post, you can tell Jekyll to format them so they are easier for the user to read. You can tell Jekyll to format code blocks using [Liquid Tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/). Liquid Tags are inside curly braces and percent signs, like this:

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript %}
This is a code block inside a Liquid Tag
Code goes here
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

# Add Line Numbers to Code Blocks

You can add line numbers to highlighted code blocks. To add line numbers, you add 'linenos' to the opening tag:

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{% endraw %}
```

When you do that, you get a code block with line numbers, like this:
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
This is a code block inside a Liquid Tag
Code goes here
{% endhighlight %}

# Name Your Code Blocks

To make it easy to assign comments to code blocks, LineComments lets you give each code block a name.

This block is named 'example codeBlock':

```
{% raw %}
{% highlight javascript %}
blockName example codeBlock
This is a code block inside a Liquid Tag
Code goes here
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

## JavaScript Finds the Line Numbers

LineComments uses JavaScript to find the line numbers on each code block. Each line number is put inside a div with a unique id. Then, when you assign a comment to a line of code in a code block, LineComments uses the position of the line number div to put the comment in the right place.

## Write Your Comments in a Div

You write your comments inside of an HTML div element. To tell LineComments that the div is a comment, assign the class "lineComment" to the div. To tell LineComments which block to attach the comment to, write a JSON object in the id property. The JSON object must have the key 'block' with the value of the name of the block the comment is assigned to. The JSON object must have the key 'line' with the number of the line that the comment is assigned to. The JSON object is inside a string. LineComments will parse 'relaxed formatting', which means you don't need to surround the keys and values inside the JSON object with quotes.

```
{% raw %}
<div class = "lineComment" id='{
    block: example codeBlock,
    line: 2
    }'>
    This is a comment on the code in line 2
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

## How Comments Look on Desktop

The comment is positioned to the left of the line number. When the user hovers the comment, it will expand to display its full text.

![desktop comment](/assets//images/lineCommentsgif.gif)

## How Comments Look on Mobile Devices

Line numbers that have comments are highlighted. When the reader clicks a line number with a comment, the comment will open. The box that contains the comment appears below the assigned line, and hovers in place. The reader can drag the screen around behind the comment. Clicking the comment or the assigned line number closes the comment.

![mobile comment](/assets//images/2020-03-14/mobileCommentsExample.gif)

## Collapsible Code Blocks

If you want to save space on the page, you can put your code block inside of an [HTML details element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details). Details elements can expand and collapse to show or hide their contents. LineComments will use JavaScript to make the details element listen for the collapse event and will close any comments inside of it when it collapses.

![collapsible code block](/assets//images/2020-03-14/collapsibleCodeBlock.gif)

Put a code block inside a collapsible details element like this:

{% raw %}

```
<details><summary markdown="span">`whatever!`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName whatever
//Hey, this is block name whatever
const sayHello = () => console.log('Hello, world!');
{% endhighlight %}

</details>
```

{% endraw %}

And assign comments to it in the normal way:

{% raw %}

```
<div class = "lineComment" id='{
    block: whatever,
    line: 2
    }'>
Hello world is the best thing to say in a program
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

Which gives you this collapsible element:

<details><summary markdown="span">`This is the collapsed code block named 'whatever'`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName whatever
//Hey, this is block name whatever
const sayHello = () => console.log('Hello, world!');
{% endhighlight %}

</details>
<div class = "lineComment" id='{
    block: whatever,
    line: 2
    }'>
Hello world is the best thing to say in a program
</div>

### Development of lineComments

# First version

The first version of lineComments just implemented the ability to tag code block lines with comments. It worked on desktop, but didn't work at all on mobile- the comments didn't show up. Lesson learned! Always develop for mobile first.

# Mobile version

Making comments on lines in Jekyll Post CodeBlocks work on mobile

# Final Improvements

o Supporting Collapsible Code Blocks
o Naming codeBlocks with relaxed JSON

# How the Code Works

-   [When the page loads, lineComments gets the window width and checks to see if it's on a mobile device.](#when-the-page-loads)
-   Then it [finds all the comments](#finds-all-the-comments), all the [code blocks with line numbers](#finds-all-the-codeblocks), and all the [details elements](#finds-all-collapsible-details-elements).
-   lineComments then runs the [initial setup](#initial-setup)
-   it changes the size, position, and format of the comments
-   if it is running on mobile, the comments are hidden
-   on desktop, comments expand when the user mouses over them
-   on mobile, comments expand when the user clicks the line number

# When the Page Loads

# Gets the window width, checks to see if itâ€™s on a mobile device

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
{% highlight javascript %}
const getWindowWidth = () =>
    Math.max(document.documentElement.clientWidth, window.innerWidth || 0);
{% endhighlight %}

# Finds all the comments

Use [`getElementsByClassName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName) to find all the lineComment divs that the user created.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName getAllComments
const comments = [...document.getElementsByClassName('lineComment')];
{% endhighlight %}

<div class = "lineComment" id='{
    block: getAllComments,
    line: 1
    }'>
getElementsByClassName returns an HTMLCollection. <br/>
HTMLCollection is array-like, but is NOT a JavaScript Array. <br/>
Use the spread operator to make it an array.
</div>

# Finds all the codeblocks

Use [`getElementsByClassName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName) to find all the code blocks with line numbers.
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName findCodeblocks
//get the line number element for each code block
const codeBlocks = [...document.getElementsByClassName('lineno')];
{% endhighlight %}

<div class = "lineComment" id = '{block: findCodeblocks, line: 2}'>
Code blocks with line numbers have the class 'lineno'
</div>

# Finds all collapsible details elements

Use [`querySelectorAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) to find all the details elements.
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName findDetails
const details = [...document.querySelectorAll('details')];
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="lineComment" id='{block: findDetails, line: 1}'>
querySelectorAll returns an HTMLCollection of all elements with the given class. <br/>
Details are collapsible elements.<br/>
Codeblocks may be inside details elements, hiding them from view until the reader opens them.
</div>

# Initial Setup

Once we have found the codeBlocks, comments, and details, we are ready to do the initial setup of all the elements. We have one function that takes care of this, `positionAllComments`. We'll call it with the `setup` flag set to _true_.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<details><summary markdown='span'>Calling `positionAllComments`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
 //set the initial position and format of all comments
    positionAllComments({
        codeBlocks,
        comments,
        details,
        isMobile,
        setup: true,
    });
{% endhighlight %}
</details>
<br/>

After that, we add an event listener to call a [debounced](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/) version of `positionAllComments` every time the page is resized.

<details><summary markdown="span">`Adding the page resize event listener`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName eventListener
    //listen for resize
    window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
        const currentWindowWidth = getWindowWidth();

        //the check for a change in window width
        if (currentWindowWidth !== prevWindowWidth) {
            //store the current window width
            prevWindowWidth = currentWindowWidth;

            //call the debounced version of positionAllComments
            debouncedPositionAllComments({
                codeBlocks,
                comments,
                details,
                isMobile,
            });
        }
    });

{% endhighlight %}

</details>

<div class = 'lineComment' id='{block: eventListener, line: 6}'>
In the mobile chrome browser, [all scroll events fire a resize](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/url-bar-resizing). <br/> To be sure that the window actually was resized, we need to check if the current window width is in fact different from the previous window width.<br/> 
Without this check, the mobile comments disappear when you scroll up.
</div>

### positionAllComments

`positionAllComments` first calculates the comment width.

<!-- prettier ignore -->
<details><summary markdown="span">Calculating width of comments</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName commentWidth
    //wrapper is an element added by Jekyll
    const wrapper = document.getElementsByClassName('wrapper')[0];
    //we use the width of wrapper as the basis for calculating how wide to make the comments
    const halfWrapperWidth = Math.floor(wrapper.offsetWidth * 0.5);
    //get the distance between the left side of the wrapper and the edge of the screen
    const wrapperLeft = getOffsetLeft(wrapper);

    //calculate commentWidth
    // prettier-ignore
    let commentWidth = isMobile
    //on mobile, it's as wide as the post element created by jekyll
    ? document.querySelector('.post-content, .e-content').offsetWidth
    //on desktop, it's the greater of 1/2 the wrapper width or the whole left offset of the wrapper
    //this will be reduced later if the screen width is very narrow
    : halfWrapperWidth > wrapperLeft
            ? wrapperLeft
            : halfWrapperWidth;

{% endhighlight %}

</details>

<div class="lineComment" id="{block: commentWidth, line: 10}">
Width is calculated differently on desktop and mobile. <br/>
</div>

<div class="lineComment" id="{block: commentWidth, line: 12}">
On mobile, we look at the `offsetWidth` property of the post content wrapper.  
</div>

<div class="lineComment" id="{block: commentWidth, line: 15}">
On desktop, we look at the size of the space between the left side of the screen and the left edge of the content.
</div>

## Setup

When the setup flag is _true_ `positionAllComments` will call three or four other functions.

-   [`parseCommentIds`](#parse-comment-ids) converts all the ids of the comments to a standard form so that they can be properly assigned.
-   [`setupCodeBlocks`](#setup-code-blocks) calls all the necessary functions to properly set up the code blocks, including formatting the comments.
-   [`identifyInvalidCommentAssignments`](#identify-invalid-comment-assignments) applies a red highlight to any comments that are assigned to an invalid block or line number, so the writer can see and fix them.

If it is being run on mobile then it will also call `closeAllComments` to hide all comments from view.

<!-- prettier ignore -->
<details><summary markdown="span">Calling setup functions</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
blockName setup
    if (setup) {
        //parse the comment ids from JSON to block.#.line.# format
        parseCommentIds(comments);

        //set up the code blocks- translate named blocks,
        //add divs and ids to the line numbers
        //add event listeners to collapsible details elements that contain codeBlocks
        setupCodeBlocks({ codeBlocks, comments, details, isMobile });

        //find all comments assigned to invalid block numbers
        identifyInvalidCommentAssignments({ codeBlocks, comments });

        //if it's mobile, all the comments start out closed
        isMobile && closeAllComments();
    }

{% endhighlight %}

</details>

# Parse Comment Ids

Users have the option of writing the comment div ids in two forms. The `parseCommentIds` function changes all the comment ids to the standard form, which is the form used by `lineComments` functions to manipulate comments while it runs.

-   Standard Form

    The standard form is 'block.blockIndex.line.lineNumber'. `lineComments` will parse this string and assign the comment to the block at the indicated index and line number.

```
block.2.line.7
```

Block indexes start at 0, so in this example, the comment would be assigned to the third code block on the page. The comment would appear next to the seventh line of code in the block.

-   JSON Form

    It's much easier to name the code blocks and assign comments to the name than it is to keep track of the block index. To assign a comment by blockName, use the JSON form of id. The Json form is '{ block: index/blockName, line: lineNumber }'. `parseCommentIds` will parse this string to JSON and assign the comment to the code block with the given index or name, and line number.

```
{
    block: My Example Block,
    line: 8
}
```

This will assign the comment to the block named 'My Example Block'. The comment will be assigned to line number 8.

Writing a properly formatted string that will parse to a JSON object using [`JSON.parse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) takes a lot of quote marks. `parseCommentIds` uses a library that allows it to parse relaxed JSON. This means you do not have to use any quotes to write the JSON form of the id.

# Setup Code Blocks

`setupCodeBlocks` first finds the named code blocks- the code blocks that the user gave a name to. It changes the ids of the comments that were assigned to named blocks so the id is in the standard block.index.line.number format.

# Add line number divs to all blocks

If you inspect a code block with line numbers, you can see the line numbers sitting inside of a &lt;pre&gt; element. You can inspect the page using your browser's console, or on some browsers there is an 'inspect element' item in the right click menu.<br/><br/>
![inspecting the lineno element](/assets//images/lineno.png)

And here's what it would look like if we had 9 lines of code instead of just 1:
![multiple line numbers](/assets//images/multipleLineNumbers.png)

These line numbers are what we want the comment boxes to line up with.

After adding a div to each line number in each code block, we can then position comments relative to that line number by finding the position of the div.

# Set up Each Code Block

For each code block on the page, the `setupCodeBlocks` function will

-   Find the comments assigned to that code block
-   If the codeblock is inside a detail element, add an event listener to the detail that will call `positionAllComments` when the detail element is toggled
-   Call setCommentContent to add the line label and content div inside the comment

# Identify invalid comment assignments
`identifyInvalidCommentAssignments` finds comments that are assigned to an invalid blockIndex and/or lineNumber. It calls `invalidCommentAssignment` to apply a css class to highlight the invalidly assigned comments in red so the user can see them and correct the mistake.

<div class = "lineComment" id='{block: nonExistent blockName, line: 5}'>
It is bright red and labeled with the blockIndex and lineNumber so the user may correct their mistake.

## Positioning the Comments

To put all the comments in the right place, for each codeBlock

-   [Determine if the codeblock is inside a collapsed details element](#is-the-code-block-in-a-details-element)
-   [Find all comments assigned to the codeblock](#find-all-comments-assigned-to-the-code-block)
-   [Calculate the left offset of the line numbers](#calculate-left-offset-of-the-code-block)

Then [position each comment](#positioncomment)

-   If inside a collapsed code block, itâ€™s hidden
-   Use offsets to find the position of a line number div on the page
-   Mobile: center the comment one lineHeight below the line number
-   Desktop- put the comment to the left of the line number

# Calculate Left Offset of the Code Block

To figure out where to locate comments on desktop, we need to calculate the left offset of a clode block. To find the left offset of an element, use a while loop to add its left offset to each of its parent elements.

<details><summary markdown='span'>`getOffsetLeft`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
export const getOffsetLeft = element => {
    let offsetLeft = 0;
    //calculates by recursively adding the left offset of each parent element

        element = element.offsetParent;
    }
    return offsetLeft;
};
{% endhighlight %}

# positionComment

The `positionComment` function puts the comment in the correct position on the screen. Use the left offset of the code block and the top offset of the line number div to find the correct position on the page. On desktop, put the comment to the left of the line number. If the comment is inside a details element, hide it. On mobile, center the comment one lineHeight below the line number.

<details><summary markdown='span'>`positionComment`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
//puts a comment in the correct position relative to its assigned codeBlock and lineNumber
export const positionComment = ({

    leftOffset,
    lineHeight,
}) => {
    //get the assigned line number
    const lineNumber = getLineNumber(comment);

    //generate the id of the assigned lineNumber div
    const id = `block.${blockIndex}.line.${lineNumber}.lineNumber`;

    //use getElementById to find the div that contains the line number
    const targetLine = document.getElementById(id);

    //find the vertical position of the line number
    const topOffset = getOffsetTop(targetLine);

    //set the position of the comment

    if (isMobile) {
        //post width is the width of the post element created by jekyll

        comment.style.width = `${commentWidth - 10}px`;

        //so the lineNumber code is visible
        comment.style.top = `${topOffset + lineHeight}px`;

# Mobile Comments

# Designing Desired Behavior on Mobile

## Designing Desired Behavior on Mobile

Here's what the new mobile comments look like:

![new comments on mobile](/assets//images/2020-02-21/new-comments-on-mobile.png){: .center-image }

To start the process of making the lineComments work on mobile devices, I first decided how the mobile lineComments should behave. I knew that I wanted the comments to basically look the same as the desktop version. This will give a more consistent user experience.

# Move the Comments from the Side to the Center

![comments in center](/assets//images/2020-02-21/move-comments-to-center.png)
There's no empty space on the sides of the blog posts when viewed on mobile, so the comments can't go on the sides. The comments have to go in the center of the screen. That's where the code block and the text of the blog post is. So the comments can't be visible the entire time.

# Comments are Hidden Until the User Opens Them

On the desktop, every comment is always visible. If the contents of the comment is long, then the comment is collapsed until the user hovers over it. Because the comments will share the center of the screen with the code and the rest of the post, the comments can't be visible all the time. They would hide other content if they were. So the comments will start out hidden. When the user indicates that they want to view a comment, that comment will open.

# Get Rid of the Arrow

![get rid of the arrow](/assets//images/2020-02-21/get-rid-of-arrow.png)
The desktop version uses CSS pseudo elements to make an arrow that points from the body of the comment to the line number it is assigned to. This visual signal connecting a comment to a line is useful when there are multiple comments on screen at once. In the mobile version, there will only be one comment open at a time. Also, the comments will be in the middle of the screen, on top of the code block. The arrow doesn't do anything useful, so let's get rid of it.

# Highlight the Line Number to Show that a Comment is Assigned to it

![highlighted line number](/assets//images/2020-02-21/line-7-has-a-comment.png)

Because the comments are hidden, there needs to be some indication that a line has a comment assigned to it. lineComments already adds a div to each line number, so we can just add a class to highlight the div for any line number that has a comment assigned to it.

# Hover is Not Convenient On Mobile Devices, Use Click Instead

The desktop version of lineComments relied on the CSS hover detection to expand and collapse the comments. I used hover because it's convenient to move the mouse over the comment you want to read. Also, CSS can accomplish hover effects with very few lines of code. So it was an efficient solution that was easy to implement.

However, hover does not work well on mobile devices. This is because the input on mobile devices is usually the touchscreen. There is no meaningful sense of where a mouse cursor is hovering, because there is only touch input when the user is touching the screen and pressing or doing a drag. Some mobile devices allow the user to give a hover input by doing a long press, but this is not something that is intuitive to do, many people aren't aware that it is possible, and it does not work on all devices.

So it's fine for the desktop to keep using hover. But using a click input to open and close the comments on the mobile version will be a lot better.

## Implement the Mobile Design

# Detecting a Mobile Device

To detect a mobile device, you essentially check some information about the browser against a very long regex list. The open source regex is maintained at [detect mobile broswers](http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/). [This stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11381730) gives a JavaScript implementation of the function. I named my version of the function `mobileCheck`. `mobileCheck` returns _true_ if the device is a mobile device, and _false_ if not.

In the setup function I call `mobileCheck` and assign the result to the variable `isMobile`. Throughout the code, if `isMobile` is _true_ then the code to implement mobile behavior will run. Otherwise, the desktop code will run.

# Toggling the State of Comments

The function `toggleMobileComment` toggles the state of a mobile comment. If the target comment is currently closed, it will be opened, and if it is currently open, it will be closed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<details><summary markdown='span'>`toggleMobileComment`</summary>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
//toggles a mobile comment between open/visible and closed/hidden states
export const toggleMobileComment = comment => {
    //all other comments should be closed
    closeAllCommentsExcept(comment);

    //style === 'none' means the comment is currently closed
    //if the comment is closed, then it should Open
    const shouldOpen = comment.style.display === 'none';

    //open or close the target comment
    shouldOpen ? openComment(comment) : animatedCloseComment(comment);

};

    //find the vertical position of the line number that the comment is assigned to
    const topOffset = getOffsetTop(lineNumberDiv);

    //set the position to absolute,
    //so that the comment will appear in a particular vertical spot in the document
    comment.style.position = 'absolute';

    //put the top of the comment 1 line height below the target line
    //but subtract the scrollY value, which is how far the user has scrolled
    comment.style.top = `${topOffset - window.scrollY + lineHeight}px`;

    //this lets the user scroll the code behind the comment
    comment.style.position = 'fixed';

    const content = comment.children[0];

    comment.style.maxHeight = '0';
